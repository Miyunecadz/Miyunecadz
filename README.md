### Hi there 👋

<!--
**Miyunecadz/Miyunecadz** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
-->

I am June Vic Cadayona, you can also call me Cadz | Jvcadz. I am a web developer, been developing web application since 2018. I am also curious of things, I love learning new things specially those things that can trigger my curiosity. I am also good at googling 🤣, I also believe in saying that "doesn't mean you depend on searching for solution makes you less programmer|developer but you don't have to invent the thing that already exist. It's the same with your reinventing the wheel which is the wheel is already exist and had been used". I think thats all for now 🤣😁

PS: I still be updating my information and maybe soon, I'll be uploading my portfolio. See you next time 👋

-- Also, if you're wondering why some repositories aren't finished, it's because they've been decommissioned due to client cancellation. Maybe I'll delete those repositories shortly or keep them and complete it. --
